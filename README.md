# pullreview

`pullreview` is a command-line tool that automates code review for Bitbucket Cloud pull requests using a Large Language Model (LLM). It fetches PR diffs, sends them to an LLM for review, and posts AI-generated comments (inline and summary) back to Bitbucket. The tool is designed for Windows and is highly configurable.

---

## Features

- **Bitbucket Cloud Integration:** Fetches pull request diffs and posts comments using Bitbucket’s REST API.
- **LLM-Powered Reviews:** Sends diffs to a configurable LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Copilot, etc.) for automated code review.
- **Customizable Prompts:** Users can edit the prompt template to control the review style and focus.
- **Flexible Authentication:** Supports credentials via config file, command-line flags, or environment variables.
- **Markdown Comments:** Posts both inline and summary comments in Markdown format.
- **Windows Compatibility:** Designed to work seamlessly on Windows systems.

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24.5 or later** ([Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/))
- **Git** (for branch detection and PR inference)
- **Bitbucket Cloud account** with an API token
- **LLM API key** (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, etc.)

---

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the executable:

```sh
git clone https://your.repo.url/pullreview.git
cd pullreview
go build -o pullreview.exe
```

---

## Configuration


All settings are managed via a single YAML config file (`pullreview.yaml`). You can also provide credentials via command-line flags or environment variables.

**Configuration Precedence:**  
1. Values from `pullreview.yaml` are loaded first.
2. Environment variables override values from the config file.
3. Command-line flags override both environment variables and config file values.

All required configuration fields must be set by one of these methods, or the tool will exit with an error.


### Example `pullreview.yaml`

```yaml
bitbucket:
  api_token: your_bitbucket_api_token
  workspace: your_workspace_id
  base_url: https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0  # Optional, defaults to this

llm:
  provider: openai
  api_key: your_openai_api_key
  endpoint: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

prompt_file: prompt.md
```


### Environment Variables



The following environment variables are supported and override values from the config file:

- `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN` – Bitbucket API token
- `LLM_PROVIDER` – LLM provider (e.g., openai)
- `LLM_API_KEY` – LLM API key
- `LLM_ENDPOINT` – LLM API endpoint
- `PULLREVIEW_PROMPT_FILE` – Path to the prompt file


### Command-Line Flags

- `--token` Bitbucket API token
- `--pr` Pull request ID (optional; inferred from branch by default)

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```sh
./pullreview.exe
```

By default, `pullreview` will:
- Infer the current PR from the active Git branch.
- Fetch the PR diff from Bitbucket Cloud.
- Send the diff to the configured LLM using the prompt in `prompt.md`.
- Post inline and summary comments to the PR.

### Specify a PR ID

```sh
./pullreview.exe --pr 123
```

### Override Credentials

```sh
./pullreview.exe --token your_bitbucket_api_token
```

## Customizing the AI Review

Edit the `prompt.md` file to change the instructions or review style sent to the LLM. This allows you to tailor the AI’s feedback to your team’s needs.

---

## Sample Workflow

1. Ensure your config (`pullreview.yaml`) and prompt (`prompt.md`) are set up.
2. Open a terminal in your repository.
3. Build and run `pullreview.exe`.
4. Review the AI-generated comments on your Bitbucket PR.
